thread is for who cannot program state machine

some times, we have to use thread. because we have to use some library that does not allow
us to do state machine and we must return back to main loop. 
For instance, if we want to use GnuTLS and glib togather.

Then , libuthread is for you. 
libuthread is a user-space thread library, thus, you must mange thread your self. but, libuthread
managers the schedule for you if you just don't want to know whitch thread should be pick up next time.

call uthread_create() to create a thread
call uthread_yield() to do thread schedule
call uthread_switchto() to do thread schedule by your self.

==============================================================
now, the topic , how is the plan ?

Well, I plan imporve schedule algorithm. Currently , it's just FIFO.
And, maybe add sleep/wakup support. Say, let sleep on a condition of a FD state.
Thus you can make block I/O as-is.
